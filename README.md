## Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.

## Functionality

The application allows the user to eat a burger by clicking on it and then the burger will moves into an eaten section.  

## Thoughts:
Burger eating is functional

## Updates:
I can improve on the CSS a bit later.
